# Mobile Device Accessibility

## Accessing Interactive Elements

- Touch elements shouldn't be right or left hand dependent. Can get around this with full-width interaction elements or containers, so someone reaching for them from either side can get to them.
- Make it clear you can interact with them by:
  * Using color schemes that communicate interactivity
  * Placing interactive elements in well-established locations for them, like the bottom navigation

## Touch Gestures

- Aim for the recommended 44x44 pixel dimensions for touch elements
  * Properly space them away from other touch elements to decrease accidental clicks
- Add instructions or good visual cues for custom gestures. These can be as simple as icons with short explainer texts explaining the action and its effect.
- Group elements that perform the same action into a singular, larger actionable item
  * For example, group the name and logo into the same anchor tag to the homepage. Don't put them each in a separate anchor tag.

## Inputs

- Specify input types so mobile keyboards can choose the best layout
  * Number inputs will show keyboards that only show numbers
- Use simpler inputs like checkboxes or radio when possible, since they're easier for small screens
