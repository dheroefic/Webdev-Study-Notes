### Care About Your Craft

Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?


### Think! About Your Work

Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.


### Don’t Live with Broken Windows

Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.
Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio
Make learning a habit.


### DRY – Don’t Repeat Yourself

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.


### Make It Easy to Reuse

If it’s easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.


### Prototype to Learn

Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you produce, but in the lessons you learn.


### Don’t Panic When Debugging

Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the bug.


### “select” Isn’t Broken.

It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application.


### Design with Contracts

Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less than it claims to do.


### Crash Early

A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.


### Minimize Coupling Between Modules

Avoid coupling by writing “shy” code and applying the Law of Demeter.


### Don’t Program by Coincidence

Rely only on reliable things. Beware of accidental complexity, and don’t confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.


### Refactor Early, Refactor Often

Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.


### Design to Test

Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code.


### Some Things Are Better Done than Described

Don’t fall into the specification spiral ?at some point you need to start coding.


### Don’t Be a Slave to Formal Methods.

Don’t blindly adopt any technique without putting it into the context of your development practices and capabilities.


### Don’t Use Manual Procedures

A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time.


### Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically

Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on a shelf.


### Coding Ain’t Done ‘Til All the Tests Run

‘Nuff said.


### Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage

Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isn’t enough.


### Find Bugs Once

Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.
