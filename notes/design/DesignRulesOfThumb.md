### Never forget C-R-A-P!

* **Contrast**
    - Don't go halfway with contrast. Either make elements very similar or very different to make their relationships clear.
* **Repetition**
    - Establish elements as having the same relationship by using consistent styles between then.
* **Alignment**
    - Ensure elements are aligned with each other in a purposeful way to give the layout structure and focus.
    - Avoid defaulting to center aligned text.
* **Proximity**
    - Similar with contrast, don't go halfway. Put elements close or far awy to establish their relationship.

### Hierarchy
* Combine different font sizes and colors to establish a hierarchy of importance.
    - Important text is larger, bolder, and darker
    - Secondary text is smaller, thinner, and lighter
    - Aim for 2-3 different shades of gray that still contrast well against the background
    - Aim for 2 font weights, a normal and heavy one (not lower than 400!)

### Typography
* Rounded fonts pair well with rounded shapes, and squared
* Always letter-space your uppercase text.

### Colors
* Find colors that match the same descriptors that you would give your typeface and your overall brand.
* Think of colors in terms of Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. This makes it easier to adjust them.
    - Use base colors as a starting point, and adjust the hue for a more suitable tone.
    - Modify saturation and brightness in opposite directions to increase contrast.
        - White text = more saturation, less brightness
        - Dark text = less saturation, more brightness
* Colors of two adjacent hues (red and orange) with high saturation don't look well together
* When matching colors to fonts, start by defining different adjectives and emotions. Pair everything else from there.
* When laying translucent black on other colors: the less luminous the color is, the more opaque the black must be to appear.
* Never use gray text on colored backgrounds to reduce contrast and importance! It's better to just make it slightly closer to the background color (either pick a specific color or white/black with reduced opacity)
* Don't always give buttons a background color. Buttons low on the hierarchy can use a transparent one.
    - Secondary buttons can just have borders, tertiary buttons can have no background or border.

Need to find good colors? Try [Dribble's Color Search](https://dribbble.com/colors/) or [The New Defaults](https://dudleystorey.github.io/thenewdefaults/).

### Borders/Shadows

* Borders/Shadows too close in luminosity (converted to grays of respective lightness) to their containers appear too strong. So a shadow with the same luminosity as a colored container will be too strong and look bad.
* The less luminous a container color is, the darker a shadow or border must be
* Box-shadows work better for more serious elements, cartoon-ish borders better for less serious ones.
* Offset your shadows. Shadows going in one direction look more natural than evenly-spaced blurs around an object.
* Don't rely too much on borders to create contrast or space, as they can quickly feel cluttered. More often aim for box shadows, different background colors, or extra spacing.
* Accent borders are an easy way to add visual flair, for components or entire layouts.

### Icons

* Try to "draw icons with the same pen," or have typography styles mirrored by the fonts
    - Sharp-cornered fonts shouldn't use icons with rounded edges
    - Aim for similar stroke weights
    - This is especially important when icons are inline with text, such as in buttons
* Don't take icons designed to be small and increase their size too much, they'll look unnatural. Either use icons designed to be bigger, or put them in a larger shape with a background color.
