> That was the problem with trying to explain how bad the feelings were, you had to believe the person you were telling had enough empathy to be able to understand (102)

> There were lots of so-called able-bodied people who were more 'disabled' than she was simply because they chose to sit around, letting their health suffer, watching television or playing videogames twelve hours out of every twenty-four. How many people couldn't write a coherent sentence, not because they had learning difficulties, but because they just couldn't be bothered to learn, and were content to have the only book they owned be the Argos catalogue? (211)

> People were not machines, with component parts you could simply swap out or remove, and even if you could, only a fool would expect what was left to remain unchanged. People were the sum total of all their parts, fundamentally indivisible ... Which experiences should we thank and which should we curse? (244-45)

> When it comes to affairs of the heart, the worst injuries we inflict often result from indifference more than cruelty. (253)

> You know what another word for normal is, Greg? Ordinary. Seems a dumb thing to aspire to when you put it like that, doesn't it? (283)

> I realized you shouldn't need to be heard. You shouldn't need everyone to understand. It's more important to know yourself, know what you're capable of, where your limits lie, what you can do, to quit worrying and accept there's no one to prove anything to but yourself. (331)

> ...just be happy with being slightly a better version of ourselves? (362)
