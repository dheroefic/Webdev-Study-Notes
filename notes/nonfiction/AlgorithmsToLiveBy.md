## Baye's Rule

## Overfitting

Overfitting is the problem when people think too much, trying to sort through and balance too many variables. Sometimes the smart move is to think less.

### Balancing Complexity

When calculating a model, using too few factors is overly-simplistic and doesn't give good predictions. But using too many factors, while making the model more accurate, is bad for predictions since it's too sensitive to sudden variations or unusual data points.

Overly-sensitive data models can't be reliably used for predictions, since it's easier for different/smaller/irrelevant factors to throw it off. It's fit too snugly into the existing data, hence _overfitting_.

Hence, getting a moderate amount of important variables for a model has a better mix of accuracy and applicability.
