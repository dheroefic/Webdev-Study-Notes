### Nurse

* Don't be afraid to ask questions about procedures and results while in the hospital.
* Read medication and prescription labels carefully - mixups kill people. Also don't talk to nurses when they're preparing meds, it makes them more likely to mess it up
* Choose your hospital well - it'll affect the entire team of medical pros treating you
* Carry a medical passport if you can
* If you have a great nurse, leave a note for their manager about why they were so great. It helps a huge amount, especially with performance reviews
* Drink 2-3 glasses of water before getting blood drawn
* After all appointments, ask yourself (and anyone else) what happens next. Know who to follow through with about results or next steps.
* Nurses do all the work that actually keeps you alive. Be grateful to them.
    - Also don't say "you're too smart to be a nurse." Pretty insulting.
* Nurses won't often tell you when something will hurt - doing so could make you imagine it to be more painful than it really is.

### Doctors

* They know more than a website does. They're the ones running your care, not the site. Doctors will at least be more accountable than them.
* If you're uncooperative, they may put you in a gown since it'll make you "subservient" to them.
* Be willing to take responsibility for your own health. Doctors aren't just there to bail you out of your health problems.
* They'll often be late to appointments since they're talking to drug reps.
* Don't get surgery on Friday. Things often go wrong the next day, and the hospital will have fewer staff and resources on Saturday.
* They're paid less well than you think. Much of the money for all the treatments and examinations goes to paying other related bills.
* Research your condition or symptoms, but don't come in expecting your doctor to take your opinions seriously.
* Bring a list of questions, even print it out and give it to the doctor. You'll likely get more time that way. Practice them beforehand.
* Bring a tape recorder and record your doctors instructions. Don't risk misunderstanding their instructions for you.
* Bring in your meds. It'll help your doctor understand more about your condition.
* Bring the following histories:
    - Your past health history
    - Your family's health history
    - Your lifestyle history (be honest!)


### Wedding Planner

* They will keep mistakes secret in order to keep things smooth for the couple (like hiding how part of the cake was eaten beforehand).
* Don't just choose the cheapest vendors to save money.
* Everything has a tax and service charge, and they add up
* They're not above manual labor, like counting dozens of used napkins
* Make sure things you buy can be re-used. Avoid overly-specific etchings, for example
* Cutting wedding costs:
    - No custom-printed invites
    - Book a budding music talent (listen to them first though)
    - Take a wedding planning class for insider info
    - Find local talent and services
    - Nonfloral centerpieces
    - By alcohol by the head, not the drink
    - Cut the cake and toss the bouquet early, so the photographers can leave early
    - Pay with your credit card to protect yourself from vendor mishaps

### Happily Married People

* A date is anything where the people are paying attention to each other
* Ask how your partner's "love tank" is for a general idea of how loved they feel - nothing personal, just a signal if they need something
* It's okay if your partner has a few habits you can't stand
* Over time they'll be less to say since you'll know your partner's response - long silences are okay
* Having a fantasy lover is fine
* Sometimes you're not as into sex at the moment as your partner is - good partners are fine with faking more interest sometimes.

### Productivity Experts

* Just 10 minutes outdoors helps a lot
* Salad beats sandwich, since protein energizes while carbs saps energy.
    - low-fat cheese
    - hard-boiled egg
    - sliced turkey or tuna
    - snack: one square of dark chocolate
    - snack: whole-grain crackers, raw veggies
* Organize engaging social work in the latter half of the day
* Isometric exercises for boring meetings - tense different muscles for 5-10 second spans
* Put manageable items on your to-do list
* Take little breaks throughout the day
* Listen to white-noise recordings or other good background noise (not videos, they're too distracting)

### Company Nurse
* Breathing deeply is an easy way to relax, as it better oxygenates your blood.
* Take some time to stretch and avoid slouching. All this encourages better blood-flow and circulation.
