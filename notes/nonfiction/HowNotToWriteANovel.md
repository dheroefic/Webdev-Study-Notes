## Plot

Good plots simply get readers engaged and turn the page, regardless of their genre or strengths. A simple fix to most plot problems: _cut to the damn chase._ Know the story to tell, the lives the characters live, and get to them as fast as possible. Write pages of the story, not trying to figure out what the story is.

### Beginnings and Setups

* _The Lost Sock, where the plot is too slight_ - The novel's central dilemma should be important enough to change a life forever. Of broad interest, so don't assume something interesting to you interests others.
* _The Waiting Room, in which the story's delayed too long_ - Don't give pages of background without the central story. Avoid scenes of characters merely mulling over background information. The story is about what's happening to the protagonist right now. Look at the first important event in your novel, and everything before that can likely be cut.
* _The Long Runway, with a purposelessly recounted childhood_ - Long childhood stories are almost always useless in the start. Save the important ones for later on, once the story is actualy underway and there's a relevant plot event bringing them up.

**Tip:** Cut through needless introductory background info by starting the book in the middle of the first pivotal action/drama/conflict scene. This gives the story momentum and you can bring in any needed background info afterwards.

* _The Vacation Slide Show, substituting location for story_ - Exotic locations don't bring any more inherent values to stories than other locations. They're good storytelling seasoning, not the main course.
* _Words Fail Me, the author stopping short of communication_ - Where great experiences aren't translated into words properly, or just use lots of vague positive ones, and it's lost on the reader.
* _The Gum on the Mantelpiece, where the reader is unintentionally misled_ - Writers create the world, so every element must have a real reason for being there. Any element given focus must come back into play for an important reason later. Focusing on something that has no importance later betrays the reader's attention.
  * These plot elements can be salvaged by making them red herrings, which misdirect readers from main plot developments so the reveals hit harder. Make sure the herrings are important to the story so the distraction isn't obvious. Also see the plot element through and resolve that part of the conflict.
* _Oh, Don't Mind Him, leaving a character's problems unexplored_ - Any character's issue, once introduced, needs to be solved in some way by the end. Just make sure all these little subplots don't overshadow the main character's development.
* _The Deafining Hug, the unintended love interest_ - Accidentally making a character appear as a love interest to the protagonist, which can throw off intended character relationships. These can include:
  * Introducing a character as attractive, immediately marking them as a love/sex interest.
  * Unneeded contact with children to avoid pedophilia insinuations (yes this is really in this book).
  * Unneeded/accidental physical contact between two male characters that sets off a reader's gaydar for infinity.

### Complications and Pacings

There's a sweet spot of plot threads, characters, and events. This balance is different for each, but there's obvious signs you missed it:

* **Monogamy** - There's only two characters following a specific plot line, and their only real interactions are with each other.
* **Onanism** - A single character without any real interactions with anyone else. Examples are stories on solo travel or pure self-discovery.
* **Serial Monogamy** - Any conflicts are solved the instant they appear, going through a to-do list of "appear and solve" plot events. Problems worth solving are worth hanging on to.
* **The Orgy** - Too many plot threads confound and throw off the user, which like an orgy will lead to a conclusion that's rushed, forced, hard to remember, and utterly unsatisfying despite all the moving parts.

* _By the Way I'm an Expert Marksman, with a pay-off that's not set up_ - Any major event or character skill should be introduced before it plays an active part in the plot. Often introduced indirectly or subtly, so the reveal still has some surprise.
* _Rose-Colored Half-Full Glasses, where the setup reveals the pay-off_ - Don't reassure the reader things are okay or make your character feel too confident. This deflates suspense and satisfaction at the resolution.
* _Deja Vu, where the setup deflates the pay-off_ - Don't tell readers what happens before it happens. A succesful plan should be withhold from the reader as it's executed. If the reader is told the plan, things should go wrong and the characters must improvise. Plans should not be spoilers.

**Tip:** Hugely unlikely events can't just happen out of nowhere for a novel. Huge luck and coincidence can only be used when that's the novel's focus. Writers must balance events of likely and unlikely occurance - the more unlikely, the more it should be set up or integrated into the novel in previous pages. Don't assume readers find unlikely events possible, even if they really happened.

* _Zeno's Manuscript, where irrelevant details derail a story_ - Needless description of details or actions can kill any scene by delaying important events. Common versions include:
  * Characters on their way to the scene
  * Getting out of bed and ready for work
* _The Plot Not Taken, where irrelevant options derail a story_ - Don't explain why the character didn't do all the things they didn't. You could write this forever, so focus more on why they did what they did.
* _The Benign Tumor, where meaningful developments are trivial_ - Scenes or chapters that are irrelevant to the real story and could be removed without issue. Even if they interest you, readers won't care.
* _Mr. Sandman Bring me a Gun, where characters dream_ - No dreams overloaded with symbolism on character's inner issues, since only the dreamer cares and not the reader. No dreams at all unless there's somehow actual plot events in them.
* _The Second Argument in the Laundromat, where a scene occurs twice_ - Don't use multiple scenes to establish what has already been done. Movies can do this as a montage, novels only need one establishing event and that's it.
  * Don't have characters talk and recount an event the reader already read.
  * Don't go to a new location to repeat and resume an event or conversation.
* _Oh, And Also? Too many recollections stall the story_ - Too many sudden memories pumps the plot's brake and cut off the real story.

**Tip:** New phone technology often cuts off many suspenseful plot ideas, since people can use their phone to quickly get needed help or info. Here's some ways to get around this and bring back the suspense.

* Forget the phone. Just set it up properly, showing the rush that forgot the phone well before the character needs it.
* Loss of phone. As long as it was in a situation precarious or risky enough to really lose a phone for good in it.
* Villian destroying the phone.
* Signal or battery failure. Just don't make it too convenient or coincidentally timed.
* Novel in a past setting before cell phones.

### Endings

* _But a Meteor Could Land There, Right? Where the author cheats_ - Resolutions shouldn't come from implausible, illogical plot twists from the author's anus. It shouldn't be external events outside the character's control that overcome issues for them.
* _"And One Ring to Bind Them!" said the Cowpoke, where  the author switches genres_ - Mixing genres can be great, but not out of nowhere to abruptly resolve the plot. Surprises must occur or been properly foreshadowed within the established world and genre's rules.
* _The Underpants Gnomes, omitting crucial steps_ - Whatever the resolution is, readers should read the clear events that cause it. Don't handwave away events that would explain how things got to this point.
* _Goodbye Cruel Reader, where inconvenient characters are conveniently removed_ - Authors shouldn't resolve issues by killing off the antagonist for the protagonist. This can be suicide, freak accidents, random murders, or being moved somewhere far away. Convenient deaths, if needed, should be foreshadowed.
* _The Manchurian Parallax of the Thetan Conspiracy Enigma, where backstory overwhelms story_ - Plot twists should be simple enough so the surprise isn't overwhelmed by confusion. Reveal bits of information related to it earlier on so the reveal can go off those.
* _Now with 20% More Homily, where the author says what he spent 300 pages saying_ - The author recounts all their themes or philosophies long-windedly at the end. They should have already been shown in the book, no need to repeat them again.

## Character

### Character Essentials

* _The Man of Average Height, where characters are described generically_ - Reveal character details you wouldn't assume based on species or gender, erring on specificity. Focus on details specific to the character, or their specific feelings about their average characteristics.
* _What Color Am I? Characters need a mirror to know their own appearance_ - Reciting routine details of self in front of a mirror is a horrible cliche. Characters can do this at any time and need no mirrors. If they have one, they usually only notice what's wrong instead of what they're used to.
* _The Kodak Moment, which is the mirror thing but with photos_ - Photos and mirrors aren't needed. A character's entrance is often enough to move to physical description. Or attach the thoughts of appearance to an emotional reaction, which also reveals a character's feelings towards it.
* _Channeling the E! Channel, where celebrities are the yarkstick_ - Never name-drop celebrities in any way when describing characters.
* _The Joan Rivers Pre-Novel Special, or focusing too much on clothing_ - Full outfit or wardrobe descriptions are rarely needed. Better to focus on one or two specific, revealing clothing details instead.

### Getting to Know Your Hero

* _The Average Day, where mundane details kill character interest_ - Routines are boring and bad for trying to give character insight. Get to the damn point.
* _The Child is Father to the Digression, or too much focus on childhood_ - Don't drown characters in backstory to explain basic feelings or beliefs. Only for more complex relationships between history and behavior. Always assume readers will find it less interesting than you do.
* _Too Good to be True, or trying to hard to make a character sympathetic_ - Perfect people make for boring stories, and most readers see them as obnoxious. Characters should have many more good traits than an everyday person does.
* _The Vegan Viking, or using politics as character accessories_ - Don't sprinkle political values on characters just to make them more likeable, or to show a likeability contrast. Also don't try and overstate how many people held them for the time or place. Political feelings if inlcuded should be plot relevant.
* _Love Me, Love My Cat. There's a cat involved_ - Don't over-emphasize pets just to make someone more likeable. If a pet isn't an important character, at most give them one sentence.
* _Compassion Fatigue, where characters are beyond help_ - Characters should have some serious problems, but not all of them or so many they can't fight back.
* _I Am Expressing my Sexuality, where sexual nature overwhelms the rest_ - Don't show ogling or masturbation early on to describe characters, since leading with that just grosses readers out. Sex-focused novels that do these are for pros only.

### Sidekicks and Significant Others

* _Jimbo Knows me Better than I Know Myself, or the purposeless friend_ - Side characters should do more than just help establish main character traits with long dialogue or needless events.
* _The Clone Entourage, or when side chracters blur together into an indistinguishable mass_ - Multiple friends needs multiple purposes and personalities, and be more than just names. If you can refer to them without mentioning specific names, remove them.
* _The Cheerleader, or a sidekick that only admires the hero_ - A protagonist's traits can't just be established by a side character saying they have them more strongly than others. It's basically aa Onanism plot with blow-up dolls.
* _The Faceless Multitude, where extras are introduced and discarded_ - Don't keep introducing characters that aren't part of the plot, only to have them be of no importance and then vanish just as fast.
* _Love-Interest Barbie, or skin-deep love_ - Physical-based love only works for viewers of movies, not readers of books. Give them loveable qualities as well as good looks. Hair colors aren't personality types.
* _Men are from Cliche, Women are from Stereotype. Building characters from gender stereotypes_ - A ocassional gender difference note is okay, but otherwise characters should aim away from gender stereotypes. Invest in what makes the characters and their relationships unique.
* _Prince Charming Doesn't Deserve Me, where the bad boyfriend is too sympathetic_ - Bad love interests must be undeniably bad with little risk for gray area. Otherwise, leaving a love interest whose boring but not bad shouldn't be seen as universally good moves.
* _The Lovely Prison Warden's Daughter, or a live interest suddenly appearing to fix a plot hole_ - Love interests that fulfill plot points can spice up a story, but not when they appear out of nowhere. Establish them beforehand so it doesn't feel like cheating the reader.
* _The Funny Valentine, where the protagonist settles for less_ - Not being shallow doesn't mean not having any standards at all. Know there's a limit to how unattractive a love interest can be.
* _Last Tango in Santa's Village, where the love interest is a sexual zero_ - Love interests can't be with zero sex appeal. Subtle makeovers or changes in perspective should highlight new sources of it, not leave it unchanged. Attractive enough to not just be "safe," otherwise we'd be in reality and not reading a story.

**Tip:** Don't stray to far from writing who you know. Avoid these character cliches:

* A gay best friend for stereotypical comic relief and thinking that just them being "gay" makes them witty and entertaining.
* An ethnic character whose only there to give other characters a chance to share progressive/liberal views on race. Ironic since treating an ethnic character like this is pretty racist.
* An ethnic character that's also just a racist stereotype. Bonus points if they classify the main character as an exception to typical racist attitudes.
* Showcasing a character's empathy by showing their reaction to a totally unrelated, giant tragedy. It's away from your own story and makes your character seem pointless in comparison.

### Bad Guys

* _Inside the Mind of a Criminal, where the villain's actions are motivated by wanting to do evil_ - Antagonists need a reason to be evil that readers can relate to on some non-sociopathic level. They shouldn't be horrible and monstrous for no real reason.
* _But He Loves His Mother, giving villains one good quality to "round them out"_ - This doesn't make villains more believable or less stereotypical. You must handle this the same as the previous tip: thinking of more reasonable reasons for their bad behavior.
* _The Retirement Speech, where the villain recounts their evil deeds_ - Don't reveal a villain's plan to the reader simply by making them brag about it to someone helpless. Use a more believable explaination or plot event.
* _Revenge is a Dish Best Served in Public, or failing to move on_ - Don't make villains and their actions a stand-in for real people that have pissed you off.
* _A Novel Called It, where abusive parents exist_ - Abusive parents sometimes work in the horror or other genres more specifically suited to them. Otherwise, they're not any more entertaining than in real life.
* _The Riddler, or an overly complex evil plot_ - Readers should be able to understand the plot enough to root for the protagonist to foil it. It shouldn't be more complex than the plot around it.
* _I'm Melting! The villain conveniently gives up_ - Villains shouldn't easily give up after protagonists being unable to defeat them for so long. Avoid fight scenes where the villain falls after one hit.
* _The Fearless Expose, or a novel full of straw men_ - Don't use villains to symbolize hated beliefs and beat up distorted versions of them. Give villains any bad traits that may be shared by people others may disagree with, but don't make it the sole reasons they're bad.

## Style - The Basics

* Don't misuse or overuse long vocabulary words. Simpler is better.
* Show, don't tell. Readers can tell a crying character is sad.
* Avoid cliches.

### Words and Phrases

* _The Puffer Fish, or flaunting your vocabulary_ - Complex writing is just showing off, and pull the reader from the book's world. Only use tougher words when it's the best way to express the idea.
* _The Crepuscular Handbag, or flaunting someone else's vocabulary_ - Don't use words you yourself don't know. Know exactly what all the words you write mean. If your vocabulary sucks, read more books.
* _The Crepitating Parasol, or tripping over your own cleverness_ - Don't try too hard to use clever puns and language. The harder you try, the most likely you are to mess it up. Good writing doesn't need flashy theatrics or prose.

**Tip:** Even a humurous or intelligent piece of writing may not fit into your novel. If it's good but doesn't serve your novel's needs, don't include it.

* _Are Sticks and Stones Still an Option? Mangling common expressions_ - Messing up idioms reliant on culture is also horrible. Google the damn things!
* _Breeding Contempt, or relying too much on cliches_ - A few uses of cliches is forgiveable. Too much and it drains your writing of meaning, and confuse metaphor with literal meaning. Save them for familiar or unsurprising events.
* _It's Important!! Punctuating hysterically_ - Avoid excessed dashes and exclaimation marks (especially the latter). Only use them sparingly in dialogue. Save them for immediate physical danger or great surprise.
  * Use italics infrequently
  * Use all caps very rarely/never
  * Never use bold

### Sentences and Paragraphs

* _The Minimalist, where synopses take the place of writing_ - Don't be overly terse. While some details have more details, there should still be enough to bring the story to life. Significant events should play out in real time with vivid detail. Get a healthy balance of events and description.
* _The List of Ingredients, or lists substitute for description_ - Don't mistake an inventory list for description. Focus on the items that make a scene unique, not all of them, and give them moderate seasonings of detail.
* _The Redundant Tautology, or the author repeating themselves_ - Do not repeat points or restate them in flowery ways to reinforce them. Mention it later in the story if it needed, but not a few sentences later. Don't use redundant descriptors either.
* _The Legal Brief, or where the language of officialdom predominates_ - Avoid legelese, officialese, or psychobabble. Any meaning behind writing can be smashed by bluntly writing it out like a law report.
* _Mouth-Watering World-Class Prose, or writing like an advertisement_ - Advertising writing forces all the biggest details into as small a space as possible, it only has seconds to do its job. This belongs inside a book cover flap, not the book itself. Avoid brand names.
* _Hello I Must be Going, where time is poorly handled_ - Don't warp time, with long-lasting events happening between two fast ones. The less important a scene is, the fewer lines you can write it in - important scenes of a few moments may be many paragraphs. Unneeded scenes can be referenced with an "After X, they..."
* _The Penis-like Sausage, or inappropriate metaphors_ - Accurate metaphors shouldn't distract from the drama or mood you aim for. Metaphors shouldn't need so much context it pulls them from the story.
* _Linearity Shrugged, or the novel happening in no particular order_ - Plot events, and sentences, must flow in a logical order. Make sure all paragraphs events are on the same topic.
* _Gibberish for Art's Sake, or indecipherable lyricism baffles the reader_ - Fancy-sounding prose is pointless if it's also difficult to understand, no matter how many other writers pulled it off. The average reader should be able to understand it.
* _The Unruly Zit, or the author that read too much Bukowski_ - Save gross details for gross moments that are meant to repulse the reader (like torture). Grossness isn't funny.
* _Ya Hadda Be There, or the author assuming the reader understands something_ - Don't convey things solely from character reactions. You also need to show what the character is reacting too.
