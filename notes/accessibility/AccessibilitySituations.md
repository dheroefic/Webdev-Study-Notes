* Stuck in an area with slow or low-quality Internet
    - Lighter page load makes it easier to navigate
    - Direct navigation and language makes it less frustrating
* Dealing with poor or glaring light
    - Proper color contrast makes it easier to discern elements
* In a public area without headphones
    - Subtitles or transcripts let people watch videos in more contexts
* Using any mode of transport
    - Large, easily identifiably elements are navigation sites and selecting elements even in a bumpy ride. Less likely to click wrong element
    - Lighter page loads help deal with likely lower-quality wifi when traveling
* Visiting an unfamiliar site
    - Emphasizing basic, direct actions over fanciness makes it easier for new visitors to quickly identify what they want. If it takes too long, even by a few seconds, they'll move on.
