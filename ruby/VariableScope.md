title: Variable Scope
descr: The different Ruby scopes and how to access them, mostly to control what's in the global scope
---

## Global

Global variables, available everywhere. Can be defined in classes and still be global, but must have `$` prepended

{% highlight ruby %}
puts global

class NewClass
  $global = "global"
end

puts $global
{% endhighlight %}

## Instance

Instance variables (`@`), only available to instances of specific classes

{% highlight ruby %}
Object = Class.new('string')   # would be initialized as "@string" in the class
puts Object.string
{% endhighlight %}

## Class

Class variables (`@@`), can be called from the class (not instances of it). These can be changed or incremented between any instance of a class, such as through the `initialize` method.

{% highlight ruby %}
class NewClass
  @@class_var = "hello!"

  def self.show_class_var
    @@class_var
  end
end

puts NewClass.show_class_var
{% endhighlight %}
