# Plot & Structure

## Putting the Big Lie to Sleep

The big lie is writing is purely a natural talent. The truth is fiction writing can be taught and learned. It needs:

1. Get Motivated. Get a ritual to keep your writing motivation strong.
2. Try Stuff. Research, take notes, and always look for new things to try.
3. Stay Loose. Relax, since too much anxiety in your writing makes you freeze up.
4. "First Get It Written, Then Get It Right." The first draft will not be perfect. Most of the work comes with fixing it.
5. Set a Quota. Set a word goal to hit every day, and track how often you hit that quota in a spreadsheet.
6. Don't Give Up. Persistence trumps talent.

## What's a Plot, Anyway?

Plot is obviously what happens. You only need to care about plot if you want to connect with readers, who will be asking:

* What's this story about?
* Is anything happening?
* Why should I keep reading?
* Why should I care?

Great characters and word choice ultimately falter and won't shine without a strong plot beneath them. This plot should pull the characters into another world or experience, and keep them there.

There are foundational rules that always result in a solid plot. Making it great depends on the author. These can be summed up by the **LOCK acronym for Lead, Objective, Confrontation, Knockout**

### L - Lead

A lead character should be compelling, since we watch them for the whole story. That doesn't mean they're perfect or too sympathetic, and should have imperfections too. They need an interesting internal dynamic, such as conflicting values or trying to untangle messes they themselves got them into.

### O - Objective

Objectives, wants, and desires are the driving forces of fiction, pushing the plot forward. Can take two forms:

* To _get_ something
* To _get away_ from something

The Lead's main Objective forms the story question: will they get what they want? The main objective must always be essential to the Lead's well-being.

### C - Confrontation

Opposition from other characters and outside forces gives the story more life. This concern for their well-being intensifies emotional involvement. Don't be afraid to put your Lead through some hell.

### K - Knockout

An ending should should a knockout victory or loss, not a muddled draw. The knockout works because it has power and is satisfying, like a massive finishing blow in boxing.

No matter how complex the plot becomes, it should always have the base LOCK setup with the Lead character at its core. This makes writing seem formulaic, but it's a formula because it works. Authors can add all their personal spices and touches to the formula to make it their own. **These spices are characters, settings, and dialogue.** These are where an author's imagination can truly shine.

For dialogue:

* Give each character a unique way of speaking. Express their personalities simply through word choice and manner.
* Show their attitudes and emotions in the moment of a conflict with their dialogue and word approaches. Dialogue is a type of weapon they wield.

## Structure: What Holds Your Plot Together

Plot is the elements, and structure is the timing of when and where to mix them together.

### The Three-Act Structure

1. Act I is being confronted with and reacting to a problem
2. Act II is trying to solve the problem
3. Act II is where we (hopefully) get a resolution and answer

The further you deviate from this structure, the harder it is to keep engaging readers.

Remember: a good novel is real life with the dull parts taken out.

### Beginnings

Introduce the Lead and connect them to the reader as fast as possible

* Present the story world
  * Info on the setting
  * The time
  * The immediate context
* Establish the tone the reader relies on. What is the pacing like? The genre? The focuses?
* Compel the reader to get to the middle. Why should they care?
* Introduce the opposition that stands against the lead

### Middles

A series of confrontations and battles between the lead and the opposition. Blossoming subplots that mix in complexity and deeper meaning.

* Deepen character relationships
* Keep the reader caring what happens
* Set up the final battle to wrap things up

### Ends

Gives the resolution, who won and who lost.

* Tie up all loose ends
* Give a feeling of resonance that echoes with the reader. What does it _mean_ in a larger sense?

### A Disturbance and Two Doorways of No Return

The story starts with the Lead in an ordinary life until something forces a change, disturbing the status quo. Something must make the reader feel there's a threat, even if it's not huge. It promises an interesting story.

The first doorway of no return is after the disturbance. After the disturbance the Lead can continue with their normal life if they want. They no longer can after passing through the first doorway. The conflict begins and keeps the character there. For example, learning a secret that the enemy seeks to hide by killing them. The Lead will need to dig deep and develop in order to survive.

The second doorway sets your Lead on a confrontation with the enemy, where neither can back out anymore. The true point of no return. Can be a crucial piece of info about the enemy, or a huge setback directly threatening the Lead. Without the second doorway the struggles after the first doorway will continue indefinitely. Passing through the second doorway means one side has to win while the other loses, and the story must end.

## How to Explode with Plot Ideas

Write from who you are more than simply what you know. You can get inspiration by asking yourself questions like:

* What do you care for most?
* Greatest fear?
* Major strengths and weaknesses?
* Good at? Bad at?
* Childhood events that shaped you?
* Bad habits?
* Darkly-held secrets?
* Philosophy of Life?

For finding good ideas, come up with hundreds of ideas and toss the ones that don't grab you. Nurture and develop what's left. Have a self-brainstorming session and do not censor yourself, just write it all down and have fun. Then assess and keep the ones you like.

### Ways to Get Ideas

* Play the "What If" game
* Make up random, crazy titles. They can be from other random writings
* Make a list of weird items
* Start with a button-pressing issue and the arguments for both sides
* Visualize something different
* Listen to music
* Start with a fascinating character. Look for inspiration in real life
* Steal germs of ideas from other plots and play with it
* Flip genre conventions on their head
* Predict a societal trend
* Read the newspaper
* Research, with material and experts
* Finish this line: "What I really want to write about is..."
* Start with a character's obsession
* Get an interesting opening line
* Write a test prologue
* Create a mind map of a topic
* Start with a knockout ending and work backwards
* Write out of pure desperation

Don't rely on drugs, alcohol, or stress.

### Nurturing Your Ideas

Give the idea a hook (the big idea that intrigues readers), a line (a brief, intriguing description), and a sinker (look at the potetial negatives)

* How much has been done before?
* Is the setting ordinary?
* Are the characters unique?
* Are the stakes high enough?
* Are there fascinating elements to add?

Narrow down your plot ideas by starting with ones you're passionate about, seeking the ones with the most potential, and trim away any blockers to that potential with precision.

## Beginning Strong

This is an expansion on all the previous points of strong beginnings. Also be sure to avoid:

* Excessive Description
* Frontloading the backstory
* No threat

### Hooking the Reader

* Use a strong opening line
  * Name the character
  * Something is happening or about to happen, which is abnormal to everyday life. A sense of motion.
    * Avoid long, static descriptions. Don't delay the character too long.
* Immediate Action
  * Can be a physical attack or unusual move
  * Can be dialogue with elements of conflict
* Raw Emotion
* Look-Back Hook
  * The character looking back at something terrible which happened, hinting an unforgettable story is about to unfold.
* Attitude
  * With first-person narration, show the characters attitude and voice to intrigue the reader
* Prologues, which need to set the reader up to move to chapter one
  * Can be an action scene setting the stage
  * A character's perspective to frame the story

### Establish a Bond Between the Reader and the Lead

Tap into your own emotional memories helps you find the core of your characters. Creating the bond itself requires four dynamics:

* Identification/Empathy
  * That the Lead is like the reader, and could see themselves in the same circumstances and reactions. They're a _real human._
    * They're trying to make it in the world. They have goals
    * A little fearful at times
    * Not perfect. Give them flaws people relate to
* Sympathy
  * Put the Lead in trouble or another kind of jeopardy. Can also be emotional.
  * A hardship or misfortune that's not their fault, like a difficult background. Just don't make them a whiner.
  * Make them an underdog.
  * Make them vulnerable, liable to be crushed at any time.
* Likeability
  * Give them traits you'd like in other people, just not too many as to make them unrealistic.
* Inner Conflict
  * Show the character's doubts
  * Give them conflicting values, such as reason and passion


### Present the Story World

Show the world and the character's current place in it. Goals related to the story world too.

### Set the Tone

Tones should have some variety throughout the story, but the dominant one should be established early on.

### Compel the Reader to Move to the Middle

By the time the Lead passes through the first doorway, an opposition of some must be established. Even if it's not that specifically known yet. Make the opposition strong, formidable, and still sympathetic to some degree.

#### Avoid Exposition Dumps

Don't tell readers something simply because they need it for what happens next.

* **Act first, explain later.** Start with the action and drop in info as needed
* **When you explain, do the iceburg.** Give the 10% and leave the other 90% below the surface. Only reveal it when needed
* **Set info inside confrontation.** Have needed info ripped out of a character by conflict.

## Middles

The middle is composed of scenes that gradually ramp up the tension and raise the stakes until the second doorway.

### Death

Good middles can include a form of death constantly threatening the Lead. Can be physical, psychological, or professional.

### The Opposition

The Opposition doesn't need to be evil, it merely opposes the main character.

* Make them a person
* If it's a group, choose someone as their lead role against the Lead
* Make the opposition stronger than the Lead
* Ask why you love the opposition. Find empathy for them.

### Adhesive

An adhesive is a reason for the Lead to stick around, continue fighting the opposition, and a reason for them to fight. Why the Lead and Opposition can't withdraw from action. The result of this is a middle being full of scenes where the Lead handles setbacks and keeps fighting back against the opposition.

Good sources of adhesive are:

* Live and Death. Staying alive is always good reason to fight back.
* Professional duty, like a cop assigned a case
* Moral duty, like saving a kidnapped child
* Obsession
* Stuck in a physical location

### ARM Yourself for Confrontation

ARM stands for **Action, Reaction, More Action.**

Each scene needs an action, something for the Lead to pursue which has an obstacle. All scenes can be spiced up with some form of conflict or tension, especially from other characters. It's good for scenes to end with a setback that makes things worse for the character in some way.

The characters then react emotionally (showing it in their own way). They come to a decision and then take more action, otherwise the plot ends there.

### Stretching the Tension

Dragging out thrilling or emotional moments for all they're worth always hooks readers.

* **Set Up the Tension.** Find the potential for damage. Make sure the conflict is worth getting worked up about.
* **Stretching the Physical.** Go through each detail slowly, alternating with methods like action, thoughts, dialogue, and description. Extend the beat of each item if you want.
  * Work hard to make these beats work together and match your novel's tone.
* Ask these questions:
  * What's the worst thing outside the character endangering them? Other people? The environment? Make it something they can't control.
  * What's the worst outcome for the character? If you get an answer fast, make it even worse.
  * Did you set up the danger well enough?

#### Stretching the Emotional

* Use alternate methods to show emotional turmoil, like physical reactions, actions, and dialogue.
* Delay answers that w
* Ask these questions:
  * What's the worst internal event that could happen to the character? It could be any kind of mental stake. For hints, look at their fears.
  * What's the worse information they could get? A secret from the past? Something they wish wasn't true?
  * Did you set up the emotional depth before the scene? We care about the characters before their problems.

Stretch scenes as much as possible in the first draft, don't worry about overdoing it. Revisions can scale them back as needed, which is easier than ramping it up afterwards.

Any scene can be stretched, but not every scene can be big and suspenseful. Save that for the most important ones.

### Raising the Stakes

Something important has to be on the line that matters. Why should the reader care? Start with a good Lead and a problem to solve, and ramp up the stakes higher. Three basic stakes come from plot, character, and society.

#### Plot Stakes

An outside threat to the lead, like a character seeking to harm them.

* Can increase the severity or scope of the consequences of losing
* Increasing the Opposition's power

Are there physical threats? New forces that join in and make things worse in new ways? Is there a professional duty at stake? What's the absolute worse thing that could befall the lead?

#### Character Stakes

What stress the character deals with, the emotional toll it takes on them, and the psychological costs they'll have to bear.

* How can things get emotionally worse for the Lead?
* Does someone care about the trouble the Lead is in?
* Does the lead have dark secrets they can reveal?

#### Societal Stakes

Actions or reactions in society can easily raise personal stakes for the character, and make accomplishing their goals harder.

* What social aspects are near the character and affect them?
* Are they dealing with a huge issue related to or talked about in wider society?
* What characters can line up with or against them?

Get a big list of all the different stakes you can think of in this category. Line them up from least worse to most worse, and aim to have them happen in roughly that order. That way the stakes find ways to keep going up.

### Energize a Lethargic Middle

* **Analyze the Stakes** - Remember all the types of stakes and see if one can be added in
* **Strengthen the Adhesive** - Bond the Lead and Opposition together tighter
* **Add More Complication** - Another variable that makes things worse in a new way and could change the entire approach to solving it
* **Add Another Character** - They should make the Lead's life more difficult, like one from their past or will betray them. Even a love interest
* **Add Another Subplot** - Do this sparingly, make sure they fit into the story well
* **Push Through the Wall** - Just keep freaking writing, or take some time off to let your passion build back

### Trim an Overweight Middle

* **Cut or Combine Characters** - Don't fall in love with them too much for this reason
* **Absorb a Subplot** - If it interests you but not readers, combine it with another or axe it
* **Trim the Dullness** - If a scene is too dull like real life, just remove it

## Endings

Endings can make or break any novel. They should feel perfect but still surprise the reader. You need to tie up all the moving threads with the right flourish, and in a way that isn't too obvious.

**Knockout Endings** have fights that seem to show one side winning, but the other side comes back with a sudden comeback. They often call on moral or physical courage to do so.

### The Ah! and the Uh-Oh!

The **Ah!** is the Lead's personal resolution once the main story has been wrapped up. It can just be a sign the emotional healing has begun for real.

The **Uh Oh!** is the opposite, a sense of foreboding. It should foreshadow something horrible beginning all over again and let the reader's imagination fill in the blanks.

### Choose Your Ending

* A positive ending is the Lead achieving their goal
* An ambigious goal leaves the reader not knowing if they'll achieve their goal.
  * A good one causes strong feelings, feels right, and generates discussion
* A negative ending has the Lead failing to reach their goal

A more complex ending makes it less clear. A good ending could come at a terrible price, or a bad ending could show the Lead on the way to getting something better.

Sacrifice is a powerful theme for endings, especially for a greater moral purpose or for those around them.

* The "final choice" ending has the Lead choosing between their objective at a moral cost, or do the right thing at the cost of their goal.
  * Sacrificing their goal with moral courage.
* The "final battle" ending has the Lead sacrifice their well-being, despite the reasons not to and the low odds of victory.
  * Sacrificing their safety with physical courage.

For twist endings, quickly think of at least ten twisty endings. Narrow them down, letting them develop in your mind and choosing the best one.

### Tying up Loose Information

Wrap up important loose ends, but don't worry about unimportant ones. But important threads need to be tidied up, even if it takes a few scenes to do so. Resolving less important threads can be fixed by characters explained how it happened. Good way to catch them is having people read the story and see if they have questions.

### Last-Page Resonance

Resonant endings stick with readers afterwards. The last impression is the one readers remember most, so it's worth the effort.

Consider the language especially carefully. If you end on dialogue, use an ironic echo or something planted earlier. Otherwise the final line will feel tacked on. Same thing for a description ending, such as familiar gestures or haunting reminders. You can also sum up a character's feelings in the end, but still end on an emotional note.

### Avoid the Rush

Don't rush through an ending out of anxiety to finish the novel, especially with a deadline. Avoid this by:

* Sleeping and dreaming, or anything to feed your imagination. Jot down your dreams, find new ways to daydream, and whatever else to feed your mind.
* Don't hold back in the first draft. You can scale it back later.
* Give yourself enough time to write it. Don't get backed into a time rush.
