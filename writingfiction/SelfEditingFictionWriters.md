# Self-Editing for Fiction Writers

## Show and Tell

Fiction can be written as either narrative summary (NS) or action scenes. NS simply tells what's happening in the story. Showing through scenes uses action like character interactions, dialogue, and description to convey the same information.

NS is bad since it pulls the reader out from the novel, making them more aware they're reading something by giving them a lecture. Some NS is needed at times, but most times it can be replaced with scenes that engage emotions rather than intellect.

### Uses for Narrative Summary

* It can vary your writing's rhythm. Constant scenes can get exhausting, and NS lets readers breathe.
* It keeps basic scenes from stretching too long, so a two-hour event doesn't take two hours to read.
* It can capture events occuring a long period of time without dragging too long or having a clunky flow.
* Summarize repetitive actions so they don't blend together. The different or important ones can act as scenes following the NS.
* Not giving scenes to unimportant plot events.

Avoid telling your character emotions, since their actions are often enough and the telling makes it repetitive. Using actions that show disgust is enough, and don't need to be followed with "they felt disgusted." Characters should show emotions in their unique ways.

A scene can mix small amounts of NS with scenes for texture, but the balance should normally be mostly showing.

## Characterizations

Characterizations shouldn't be told to readers upfront. Characters should be introduced with a few key physical details (enough to get an image in their minds), and let their personality be shown through their actions, words, and interior monologue. It's more enjoyable to gradually see their depth revealed naturally through the story, and develop their own judgements of them. Throwing in a full characterization from the start risks boxing them into that, leaving no room for intuitive growth.

Flashbacks should be used scarcely, and only for crucial pieces of the past. Otherwise past information should br brought to light in the present. Extensive character histories can help flesh out a character but are often irrelevant to the reader.

### Showing Characters

* Have one character characterize them through their perspectives and opinions
* Dialogue and action beats
* Share the character's views on other topics

## Exposition

Exposition should also be unobtrusive, and be given in smaller doses only as the reader needs them. Background info should be worked into the story in pieces so it doesn't choke ther reader, and be woven naturally into the story.

Dialogue is great for giving exposition, but characters shouldn't talk this way solely to give information (like answering many questions over the phone, or bland interior monologue). These can work with the same showing strategies as used for characters.

Expositions that introduce readers to a new culture can be handled the same way. Dropping readers into the culture and hooking them with other story elements (like a powerfully emotional scene) can keep them going even though they won't learn everything right away. Finding answers is part of what keeps them reading, and the readers are trusted to keep up with the story.
